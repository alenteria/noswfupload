# noSWFUpload #
Multiple files upload without SWF objects, applets Java, or other third parts plug-ins.

## Features ##
  * 100% browser and W3 compatibility thanks to graceful enhancement
  * no extra libraries dependency
  * simple and low level API
  * wide browser compatibility in **3.63** **KB** (minified and gzipped)

## Compatibility ##
  * Internet Explorer 5.5 (probably 5 too), 6, 7, and 8
  * FireFox 3 or greater
  * Google Chrome 1.0 (V2 Coming Soon)
  * Opera 8, 9, and 10
  * Safari 3, Safari 4 (current beta)
  * other browsers via unobtrusive iframe


## Description ##
Recent browsers could make upload file via Ajax possible and in some case knowing how many bytes have been sent to the server.
This means that we could start to avoid usage of third parts plug-ins such [Adobe Flash Player](http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/), [Silverlight](http://silverlight.net/), or others, since these are not necessary anymore!


## Goals ##
noSWFUpload aim is to have at least one alternative to common techniques used today to implement multiple files upload and mainly based on Adobe Flash Player (example: [FileReference JavaScript Porting](http://www.devpro.it/FileReference/) or [SWFUpload Project](http://swfupload.org/))

## Credits ##
I spent half a day to find a name for this project and the simplest one I could find was adding a prefix to another project which I respect and which I suggest as valid alternative when Adobe FLash Player is installed. This project is [SWFUpload](http://swfupload.org/).
Special thanks goes to famfamfam website for its extremely useful and general purpose [Silk Icons Set](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/)
A thanks goes to Ionut G. Stan for his [blog post about boundary via FireFox](http://igstan.blogspot.com/2009/01/pure-javascript-file-upload.html).

## Documentation ##
So far I wrote a lot of stuff inside files included in the zip but I am trying to create an appropriate Wiki section to describe as soon as possible the project in this space.
**Update**
THe [Wiki section](http://code.google.com/p/noswfupload/w/list) has been populated with FAQs and other tips and tricks.
